# Improve README Accessibility and Scannability

The README is written in a professional tone but can be optimized for accessibility and quick understanding.

#### Suggestions:
- Add subheaders to separate sections more clearly.
- Simplify technical jargon where possible or provide explanations/links to help newcomers.
- Use bullet points or tables where appropriate for better information segmentation.
